WILL BARNES died February 20, 2012 with his wife Vickie by his side. His death is a great loss to the pro-revolutionary milieu, a milieu that he energetically interacted with both theoretically and practically. Will was dedicated to proletarian revolution. On his website he stated:

> “We do not seek a better deal for labor within capitalism; we are not reformists. Rather, we aim at the abolition of the order of capital in its entirety; we are revolutionaries, communists, and councilists of sorts… We seek a mass appropriation of revolutionary ideas.“

Although I never met Will, I felt like I had a sense of him, of his ideas and concerns. I first read him on the Meltdown list where he put forth a text on the critique of science, “Lest our Hopes and Dreams Become an Endless Nightmare: Capitalist Technology, the Modern Science of Nature and the Movement of Capital”. Later, through email exchanges, Will emphasized his profound concerns about the environment and the increasingly destructive tendencies of capitalism in crisis:

> “My Marxism is not Promethean: I think there are forces in nature that humanity cannot master, a perspective that I think I rationally and rather persuasively explain and defend in the essay I just mentioned. I think, further, that climate change is one of those forces. Once we reach a tipping point, those forces are unleashed, a logic in nature will fully assert itself, and the human achievements that make a general emancipation possible will begin to dissolve… A proletarian revolution can come too late…”

Will linked this ‘tipping point’ to the endless development of the productive forces; to the logic of capitalism. He considered one of his preliminary tasks to be to demonstrate that capitalist science and technology related to nature solely as so much disposable matter. Basically seeing ...”earthly nature as a holding arena consisting solely of unprocessed resources, for which all of reality has the meaning of a raw materials basin for capitalist commodity production...” His concern that a proletarian revolution may come too late, however, did not stop him from practical revolutionary activity... his interventions spanned his entire adult life. In a January 20, 2012 email, one month prior to his death, he wrote:

> “Going back forty plus years, I have coordinated with a handful of others large-scale antiwar (Vietnam) demonstrations, marches and rallies; spoken before factory proletarians on the issues of the day; been actively involved in solidarity work for a native people under enormous pressure from value-form penetration, experiencing incipient class stratification and occupied by the national guard (I argued for our organizational involvement with an emerging proletarian axis in the native community); have actively participated in intra-class strike support in a major strike situation; as casualized, have been fired for refusing to cross a picket line, and have been fired for openly and fully defending co-workers; have put myself personally at risk for defending black workers against Klansmen (I lived in the mid-South for 17 years); and I have become increasingly isolated for the last several years for arguing in the drivers union for strike action which is effectively outside the union (in a union that has never struck).
This is not a display; rather, it is an effort to state that I have some experience and familiarity with various proletarian milieus.”

Will Barnes’ death is a huge loss to all: to those in his personal life whom he left behind and, for us, the tiny revolutionary movement to which he richly contributed.
