In all small political groups, there are occasional episodes of dysfunction; Internationalist Perspective is not immune from this and, indeed at our annual conferences over some years, all of our members have voiced such concerns and we tried to get to the root of the problems. The dissatisfaction felt about the quality of our collective work is shared and, if we want to suggest a major cause, it is linked to the general difficulty in being able to carry out revolutionary work in the present phase of capitalism's development, and few opportunities to hold common meetings. We won't here go into that general matter, but we do want to describe some recent difficulties.

In International Perspective 57, dated Fall/Winter 2012, we published the first part of a text entitled 'International Perspective and the Tradition of the Communist Left' (IP&CL). It was presented as a draft text and the brief introduction to it declared an intention to adopt such a document at our next conference which was to be held mid-2013. In Internationalist Perspective 58/59, dated Winter 2013/2014, the introduction to parts 2 and 3 of this document stated that:

> "In a series of three texts we developed our critique of the Communist Left and, at the same time, spelled out our own views on the questions they confronted and which still confront us today, ranging from theoretical to practical: how can we understand social reality, history, the periodization of capitalism, crisis and revolution. ...

> "At its conference last summer (i.e. summer 2013), IP collectively discussed, amended and approved the three texts. IP does not have a platform, but this series is the most comprehensive exposition of our positions since 'The world as we see it' in IP#27 (1994) (readers who compare the texts will notice our considerable evolution since then)."

However, towards the end of 2013 it became apparent that there were widely disparate views about the status and content of this work. For some, IP&CL was a landmark in the exposition of our positions but for others the document constituted only a discussion text. This situation is indicative of the dysfunction within IP, inasmuch as frank discussion had become difficult within the group.

How these two different perspectives coexisted at the 2013 conference is still a mystery to us all – and one we must solve. So, to avoid any doubt, we have to clearly recognize that the statement that this series is a "comprehensive expositions of our positions" is wrong and that IP&CL cannot be regarded as the view of IP as a whole. The disagreements are more focused on the first part of the IP & CL text. Indeed, some of our members question whether the basis for traditional Marxism's productivist, determinist, teleological view of human history was already present in the early writings of Marx and continued to be present in the Communist Left (Dutch, German as well as Italian), as is claimed in the first part of IP & CL. These comrades also do not understand why "contingency" is now given so much weight as a factor shaping history, as is the case in the text. Another critique is that while the text correctly gives a huge importance to the value-form critique, it does not devote enough attention to how the value-form shapes the revolutionary subject, and the development of revolutionary consciousness in the present period. In addition, one comrade objected to the use of the term "traditional Marxism" to designate the theory we reject, and he prefers the term "scientific socialism", which in his view did not affect Marx, or the Communist Left. 
 
We all agree that the comrades who are critical of the text IP & CL should write and publish their views in IP. Unfortunately, no text was yet ready for this issue of IP. Readers are urged to follow the "news" on our website, where the texts will be published as soon as they are finished.

Meanwhile, we continue to discuss.
 
Sadly, one of our comrades, in the face of the dysfunction has resigned during the period when we were becoming aware of the differences within IP.
This difficult situation has had several repercussions. On the negative side we are no longer capable of producing Internationalist Perspective in two languages – so we shall no longer publish the French review. Perspective Internationaliste 58/59 was the last one. For now. We have, however, decided on some actions to move our work forward:

We have recognized the need to have a reference text to provide a coherent exposition of our shared views. Discussion has begun and we would hope to have it agreed at our next conference mid-2015.

The website will become the principal means of publishing our work. It is currently being rebuilt (long overdue) and we aim to have it live by the end of 2014.

We are trying to get to the bottom of the dysfunctions that have affected our work. Although not the underlying cause, our dispersion has created difficulties (we have four native languages and seven time zones between us) and we shall try to be very conscious of the state of our various discussions.
We believe Internationalist Perspective has made a worthwhile contribution to the development of Marxist theory and has endeavored to intervene in social struggles to the degree we could. All of us in Internationalist Perspective wish to continue with this activity.
