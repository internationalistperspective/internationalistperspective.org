This book is an important and comprehensive contribution to the highly abstract categories that appear in Marx’s *Capital*: abstract labor, the value-form and the role of money in a commodity producing society. It is without doubt the most exciting text to come out of what is called the “new reading of Marx”. What does this new reading mean and how does it diverge from the old reading? Those involved in the ‘new reading’ primarily believed that a different *approach* to reading Marx was needed and that the emphasis should be on seeing Marx’s *Capital* as an incomplete project within which there are unsolved problems. Heinrich notes that the process spanned an approximate 20-year period from the *Grundrisse* to the last pages of *Capital* (1857 – 1875). At the same time there was what Heinrich calls an “historical accident” that supported this new approach with the publication of the MEGA (Marx Engels *Gesamtausgabe*) which is 140 volumes of their work much of it still waiting to be translated, untouched by editing, in the original German. The fact that only a small part of what Marx and Engels wrote is actually available, adds to the feeling of discovery, and the knowledge that *Capital* is not the last word. *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Karl Marx’s Capital* (hereafter *An Introduction*…) is about questioning the status of *Capital* as a completed project. It is a book that has provoked controversy (See the article on crisis theory in this issue of *Internationalist Perspective* by Sander) as well as enthusiasm.

Basically Heinrich, a leading representative of the new reading, emphasizes that *Capital* is above all, a “critique of political economy”, with a focus on value and value-form, which, apart from I.I. Rubin’s *Essays on Marx’s Theory of Value*, (in the late 1920s) and much later in the 1970’s, with the German debates, has been, as Heinrich notes, ‘largely neglected’, even though ‘it is the longest section’ in chapter 1, of vol. I, of *Capital*. (In his book, Heinrich does not mention Rubin’s contribution, but in one of his lectures he praises the work.)

For Heinrich: “Marx’s theory of value, as a monetary theory of value, is not a theory about the distribution of social wealth, but rather a theory of the constitution of the social totality under the conditions of capitalist commodity production.” (Footnote 46, Endnotes 2, page 92) As *Endnotes* 2 correctly stresses: “The issue was thus shifted from one of distribution to an overcoming of the form of labor, of wealth, and the mode of production itself.” (Ibid)

Heinrich clearly shows the destructive potential of the value-form to both human kind and nature, when he writes: “The sole aim of capitalist production is the constant production of surplus value. Competition forces the individual capitalist, on pain of his ruin as a capitalist, to make the hunt for increasing surplus value the aim of his activity. *Nature*, just like labor-power, is merely an instrument for attaining this goal. In accordance with its intrinsic logic, capital is just as indifferent toward the destruction of the natural foundations of life … as it is toward the destruction of individual labor-power.” The urgency of the present situation today can be seen in Heinrich’s discussion of capitalism’s destructive potential and in its accelerating barbaric course. “The destructive potential of capital does not just assert itself in the way a technology is *applied*, but in the *choice* of particular technical-industrial *paths of development.”* (Page 117) The above statements point to the necessity of the rejection of the value-form, the subjection of humankind to labor *time* as the measure of value, and the money form as its embodiment . Schemes for a redistribution of wealth proposed by the left from “orthodox” Marxism to progressives like Piketty (See the critique of Piketty, by Sander, in this issue of *IP*) can only ideologically bind the worker to *capital* with their claims that they can solve its crisis. Heinrich, by contrast, shows the vacuity and political danger of just such “programs”. A lecture, on the capitalist state, by Heinrich, (“The bourgeois state: class domination and impersonal rule”) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoHDL0nHimU)

Heinrich’s explanations are given clearly and promote a deeper understanding and questioning of the categories and conceptions mentioned above, which, for many readers of Marx’s *Capital*, including myself, have always presented a daunting challenge. The depiction by Heinrich, of Marx, is entirely new and fresh. Marx appears through Heinrich’s eyes as a man who was constantly developing his ideas, which often resulted in profound changes to what he had formerly thought and written, (e.g. thinking that the crisis in 1848 would bring the collapse of capitalism, and revolution, to realizing in 1859 that crisis made capitalism stronger or, in some cases, even dropping entire conceptions held at an earlier time (e.g.: “his concept of ‘human essence’ or ‘human species being’ …no longer surfaces in Marx’s work after his Theses on Feuerbach and the German Ideology.”). Alienation is spoken of only “vaguely and rarely”. Did he actually discard the theory? At any rate, “it is not in the foreground any longer” (Page 21 – 22).

This leads me to conclude that alienation from a human essence gives way to commodity fetishism and reification, both linked to historically specific capitalist social relations.

Heinrich’s book involves a developed critique of traditional/orthodox Marxism and explains “world-view Marxism”, the latter view entails the same characteristics as the former – “crude economism” and “historical determinism” - and is a descriptive phrase that accounts for the type of demands made by the working class movement in the pre-World War I period, “a movement that wanted a comprehensive explanation of the world \[“*Weltanschauung*” or world view\] offering an orientation and answers to a wide range of subjects from questions of philosophy to science and politics.” (Page 24)

World-View Marxism grew up in the period when Marx and Engels were active in the Social Democratic Parties; “Marx and Engels constituted a sort of think tank…they were asked to state their positions concerning the most varied political and scientific questions.” During this time Engels, “…composed a series of popular works for the Social Democracy (the SPD), in particular the so-called *Anti-Dühring*. The *Anti-Dühring* and above all the short version, *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific*” represented an effort “…to critically engage with the ideas of Eugen Dühring,” who “…claimed to have developed a new, comprehensive system of philosophy, political economy, and socialism and was able to win an increasing number of adherents in the German Social Democracy.” (Page 23)

Engels books “were widely translated and read”; however, Heinrich noted that *Capital* on the other hand, “was usually taken note of by only a small minority.” (Page 23)

*Heinrich describes the social climate of that pre-war period:*

> “After the worst outgrowths of early capitalism had been eliminated and the everyday existence of the wage-dependent class within capitalism was somewhat secure, a specific Social Democratic workers’ culture developed: in workers’ neighborhoods there emerged workers’ sports clubs, workers’ choral societies, and workers’ education societies. Excluded from the exalted bourgeois society and bourgeois culture, there developed within the working class a parallel everyday life and educational culture that consciously attempted to distance itself from its bourgeois counterpart, but often ended up unconsciously mimicking it… Within this climate, there emerged the need for a comprehensive intellectual orientation that could be opposed to the dominant bourgeois values and worldview, in which the working class played no role or merely a subordinate role.” (Page 24)

Unfortunately, in his critique of Dühring, “Engels not only criticized Dühring but also sought to ‘counterpose’ the ‘correct’ positions of a ‘scientific socialism’ and, in so doing, he laid the foundations for worldview Marxism, which was appreciatively taken up in Social Democratic propaganda and further simplified.” (Page 24) World view Marxism had little to do with a scientific approach to Marx’s *Capital*; it “…played above all an identity constituting role: it revealed one’s place as a worker and socialist, and explained all problems in the simplest way imaginable.” It was more like a religion which tried to give answers to nearly everything. This can be seen later in a statement by Lenin who was “intellectually rooted in worldview Marxism…”: “The teaching of Marx is all-powerful because it is true…” (Page 25)

I have selected passages related to specific sections of Heinrich’s book and lectures to facilitate what I think are the most difficult in the reading of Marx’s *Capital* and also the least discussed. These selections revolve around the categories of: the commodity-form, value-form, abstract labor, fetishism and the money-form.

Heinrich emphasizes that the aspects of value theory that are highlighted are not *restricted* to the first seven pages (out of a total of fifty) of the first chapter of *Capital*: “For many Marxists, and most of Marx’s critics, this constitutes the core of Marx’s value theory: The commodity is use value and value, value is an objectification of human labor, the magnitude of value depends upon the ‘socially necessary labor-time’ required for the production of a commodity (the last point is frequently referred to as the ‘law of value’). If that were actually all there is to it, then Marx’s value theory would not have gone very far beyond classical political economy. But the central value-theoretical insights of Marx are not limited to these simple propositions.” (Page 44-45)

### Marx Breaks with the Past

Heinrich highlights the breaks Marx made with the classical and neo-classical bourgeois economists and calls it a “scientific revolution with political intentions”. In other words, it was not just one theory or several theories that he critiqued but he critiqued their *whole approach*. As already mentioned above he broke with the concept of human essence, (‘there is no such thing as a human essence whether today or 1000 years ago’); individualism, (‘individuals are embedded in social relations’); empiricism, (‘although he \[Marx\] was the forerunner in using empirical data he knew that society cannot be interpreted through such data’); and trans-historicity, (‘that economic problems are the same today as yesterday e. g. there are limited means and infinite aims, the basic structure is the same, with no conception of historical and social form’). For a discussion of these remarks by Heinrich see: [“Public Discussion with Michael Heinrich”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLiCRnsHf7s) – March 2014 (hereafter – “Public Discussion”)

On page 33 of *An Introduction…,* Heinrich elaborates on this ‘scientific revolution’: “However, as the subtitle of *Capital* makes clear, Marx’s intent was not to provide an alternative ‘political economy’ but a *critique* of political economy…he wanted to criticize the *categorical presuppositions* of an entire branch of knowledge.”

*Capital* begins with the most abstract categories, that of value and the commodity form. The idea that labor is the basis of value was a connection made by the classical and neo-classical economists but the question of “*why*” this is the case was never discussed; it was rather assumed. In other words, why do the products of labor take the form of value, of the commodity? “This is not natural, it cannot be taken for granted, and it is an expression of a specific social structure, and this social structure, as structure, was not analyzed in classical theory.” (“Public Discussion”) (See Page 76 of *An Introduction*…)

### Commodity Producing Labor

Since Marx’s approach was to critique *categorical presuppositions* the distinction between concrete and abstract labor in a commodity producing society had to be thoroughly investigated. “To understand what’s behind the specific social character of commodity producing labor, we have to deal with the distinction between ‘concrete’ and ‘abstract’ labor. In most accounts of Marx’s value theory, this distinction is briefly mentioned, but its importance is frequently not understood. Marx himself pointed out its fundamental significance:

> ‘*I was the first to point out and to examine critically this twofold nature of the labour contained in commodities. As this point is crucial to an understanding of political economy; it requires further elucidation.’”* (*Capital*, 1:132) (Page 48)

In other words, Marx’s *scientific approach* was based upon a *radical* critique of the prevailing labor theory of value. During Marx’s time there were two discourses on value that existed. The prevailing and traditional discourse (the substantialist view - based upon the Aristotelian view), was the view of value as a substance, “*restricted*” to an attribute of a single commodity, of a certain amount of labor time “*embedded*” in the commodity itself. The other discourse, introduced by Marx, was the notion of value substance as a “*relational*” substance and as a “*common*” substance. When ‘substance of value’ is viewed as a ‘*relation*’ then it can only *appear* in a relation, it cannot *appear* in a thing. (“Public Discussion”).

On page 48 Heinrich writes: 

> “*Every act of labor whose product (which can also be a service) is exchanged produces value.* As values, the commodities are *qualitatively* equal; therefore the various act of labor that produce values must have the status of *qualitatively equal human labor*. Carpentry does not produce value as carpentry (as carpentry, it produces a chair); rather, it produces value as human labor, whose product is exchanged with other products of human labor. So carpentry produces value precisely as *labor abstracted from its concrete manifestation* as carpentry. \[“All its sensuous characteristics are extinguished” (*Capital, vol. 1*, page 128) - CH\]**.** Marx therefore speaks of value-producing labor as ‘abstract labor’.”

However, on page 50, Heinrich writes that Marx 

> “…speaks of abstract labor as ‘an expenditure of human labour power, in the physiological sense’ (*Capital* 1:137)… this formulation suggests that abstract labor has a completely non-social, natural foundation, and has therefore accordingly provoked ‘naturalistic’ interpretations of abstract labor.”

Heinrich also notes in the “Public Discussion” lecture that the formulation above by Marx regarding abstract labor as “physiological”, is “pure nonsense” as value producing labor has nothing to do with labor in the physiological sense…that, in fact, Marx was trying to make abstract labor more “plausible” to the reader. But also that Marx was a “human being” and at times “lapsed” back into the substantialist view of value (value as non-relational). Others do not agree and criticize Heinrich for his claim that Marx had “lapses”. In my opinion, *radical* breaks with the past (even for Marx), do not always proceed in a straightforward, linear, direction.

### Value As A Relation and As A Common Substance

This idea of value as a *relation* and as a *common* substance is presented by Marx, in *Capital* vol. 1, chapter one, “The Commodity”:

> “Not an atom of matter enters into the objectivity of commodities as values; in this it is the direct opposite of the coarsely sensuous objectivity of commodities as physical objects. We may twist and turn a *single* commodity as we wish; it remains impossible to grasp it as a thing possessing value. However, let us remember that commodities possess an *objective* character as values only in so far as they are all expressions of an *identical* social substance, human labour, that their objective character as values is therefore *purely social*. From this it follows self-evidently that it can only *appear* in the social relation between commodity and commodity. In fact, we started from exchange-value, or the exchange relations of commodities, in order to track down the value that lay hidden within it \[the exchange relation - CH\]. We must now return to this *form of appearance* \[exchange value - CH\] of value.” (My emphasis). (*Capital*, Vol. 1, Page 138 -139)

The *form of appearance* for Heinrich, and for Marx, is a *necessary* appearance, without which value analysis could not take place. Value substance is a *relational* substance, and it is this form of appearance (exchange value) which is foundational to being able to “catch” the *content* of this relation. The content of this relation is value producing abstract labor. Therefore the content of abstract labor cannot be analyzed outside of this social form. (“Public Discussion”).

In speaking about abstract labor below, Heinrich quotes Marx:

> “The reduction of various acts of labor to this abstraction of equal human labor is only carried out through exchange, which in fact equates products of different acts of labor with each other.” (Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe or MEGA, II.6:41; French translation) (Page 50)

### What constitutes value in a commodity producing society?

Heinrich writes on page 51: “If a greater quantity of a use value, a linen sheet for example, is produced beyond that of the (monetary) demand existing in society, then this means that ‘too great a portion of the total social labour-time has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time on his particular product than was socially necessary’ (*Capital*, 1:202).” At any given point of time, “…labour-time expended under the average existing conditions of production *as well* as for the satisfaction of monetary social demand constitutes value. To what extent the privately expended labor was actually necessary to satisfy demand depends on the one hand upon the amount of this demand and on the other hand upon the volume of other producers – both of which first become apparent in exchange.” On page 113 Heinrich writes: “…The capitalist is not interested in the *value* of a product but rather *surplus value* or profit, as the case may be…the capitalist introduces an increase in productivity so that his individual costs are lower than the social average, so that he not only obtains the normal surplus value, but an extra surplus value (extra profit).” Obviously what constitutes social necessary labor-time changes as productivity increases.

In the 3rd chapter of *An Introduction*…, Heinrich takes the reader through the process of a categorial unfolding of value, labor and money, and step by step shows how each category is entwined with and dependent on the other.

### Abstract Labor/Value Objectivity and the Commodity Form

On Page 52, Heinrich states: “Value-objectivity (*Wertgegenstandlichkeit*) is not possessed by commodities as objectifications of concrete labor, but rather as objectifications of abstract labor. However, as we just outlined, abstract labor is a *relation of social validation* \[meaning a “real abstraction” – “…an abstraction that is carried out in the actual behavior of humans, regardless of whether they are aware of it” Page 49 \] existing only in exchange (where privately expended labor counts as value-constituting, abstract labor) then value also first exists in exchange. What’s more, value is not at all a property that an individual thing possesses in and of itself. The substance of value, that constitutes the foundation of this objectivity, is not inherent to individual commodities, but is bestowed *mutually* in the act of exchange.”

Heinrich reinforces the above statement with further remarks from Marx below.

*Heinrich:*
> “The most emphatic statement on this by Marx can be found in his revised manuscript for the first edition. There he states that when a coat is exchanged for linen, then both are “reduced to an objectification of human labor per se.” (Page 53)

*Marx:* 
> “However, it should not be forgotten that: *none of both* \[neither the coat nor the linen, CH\] *is in and of itself value-objectivity* \[*Wertegegenstandlichkeit*\], they are this only insofar as that this *objectivity is commonly held* by them \[the common substance of abstract labor -CH\]. Outside of their relationship with each other - the relationship in which they are equalized – neither coat nor linen possess value-objectivity or objectivity as congelation of human labor per se. (MEGA, 2.6:30)

As a consequence,

> a product of labor, considered in isolation, is not value, nor is it a commodity. It only becomes value in its unity with another product of labor.” (MEGA, 2.6:31) (Page 53)

You can see by the above statement that Marx was very interested in explaining *value-objectivity* and also explaining in precise terms what constitutes a *commodity*.

Heinrich too, in discussing the commodity, is very precise in his definition. For example, he is careful to emphasize that even though commodities have existed historically, that: “Only with capitalism does wealth take the form of a ‘collection of commodities’ and only with capitalism is the commodity the ‘elementary form’ form of wealth. This commodity, the commodity in capitalist societies, is what Marx intends to analyze.” (Page 40)

Therefore, it appears to me that while commodities, indeed, predate capitalism, as others have highlighted, (even going all the way back to the Ancient World), what is essential to understand is that “value objectivity”, is historically specific to capitalism. One of the bases of Marx’s critique is that value objectivity is not a universal feature of human existence as classical political economy claimed and in fact, as a critique, value objectivity provides powerful ammunition for the demolition of political economy.

On the same page Heinrich talks about the “chair” as a useful product, but only a commodity if it is to be exchanged, and further, “That the chair is a commodity is not a characteristic of the chair itself as a thing, but rather of the society in which this thing exists.” (Page 41).

And therefore, regarding exchange and the history of it in relation to capitalism he writes: “Individual acts of exchange occur in all forms of society that are known to us. But it is a specific aspect of capitalist society that almost everything is exchanged.” (Page 41)

Heinrich makes the point – with which I agree -- that in *Capital*, Marx’s focus was specifically on a theoretical analysis of capitalism and the unfolding of its fundamental categories, (value, the commodity form, abstract labor, money) which remain operative through all historical variations of the capitalist mode of production, so that one can speak of “‘capitalism’ as such. (p.31) and see those social forms as constitutive whenever capitalism has historically arisen and shapes social relations.

Before turning to a discussion of the fetishism of commodities or the *spectral objectivity* of the commodity form one might ask why this is important, or what the political significance of such a discussion might be. I think it directly relates to both the challenges and the obstacles to the development of any kind of revolutionary class consciousness on the part of the working class as a revolutionary *subject*. Discussion about *spectral objectivity* is not an *academic distraction*, quite the contrary. It relates specifically to what makes capitalist social relations *opaque*, it is why Marx specifies the commodity form as “*mysterious*”, how it appears *natural* and *eternal* *not* *only* to the working class but to the capitalist class as well. Comprehending the core social relation (wage labor and capital) cannot be done outside of the concept of spectral objectivity. Therefore one wonders, along with Heinrich why the subject of Marx’s value-form, within which he describes fetishism and spectral objectivity, has been so neglected.

### Real Abstraction and Spectral Objectivity

Heinrich writes that a “real abstraction”, is a social behavior or action that is carried out by humans whether or not they are aware of it (“carried out in the social process independently of the thoughts people have,” “behind their back”, so to speak). In the Public Lecture discussion of real abstraction, Heinrich notes that this expression “real abstraction” was coined by Alfred Sohn-Rethel.

He is referring to the “spectral” character of value objectivity, and to what Marx calls “the fetishism of the commodity and its secret”.

Marx discusses this “enigmatic” and spectral character of the commodity extensively in vol. 1, chapter one, section 4, and Heinrich quotes Marx in relation to this discussion on Page 72-73 of *An Introduction…*

#### Marx asks the question:

> “*Whence, then, arises the enigmatic character of the product of labour, as soon as it assumes the form of a commodity?”

#### And he gives this response:

> Clearly it arises from this form itself. The equality of the kinds of human labour takes on a physical form in the equal objectivity of the products of labour as values; The measure of the expenditure of human labour-power by its duration takes on the form of the magnitude of the value of the products of labour; and finally the relationships between the producers, within which the social characteristics of their labour are manifested; take on the form of a social relation between the products of labour.
>
> The mysterious character of the commodity-form consists therefore simply in the fact that the commodity reflects *the social characteristics of men’s own labour as objective* \[reified – CH\] *characteristics of the products of labour themselves, as the social-natural properties \[gesellschaftliche Natureigenschaften\] of these things. Hence, it also reflects the social relations of the producers to the sum total of labour as a social relation between objects, a relation which exists apart from and outside the producers.*” *(Capital*, 1:164-65; emphasis added)

Therefore, because the worker sees the commodity form as *natural*, and as an *objective* feature of the product itself, he/she feels powerless to abolish it. Yet it is his/her own social action that creates it, and that can potentially eliminate it. Therein, lies the political significance for a discussion of the *enigmatic* and *spectral* character of the commodity.

However, as we know, it is both the theoretical deepening and the practical experience of the working class that can bring hope of change.

“Clearly, the contradictions are our hope, and not a contradiction-free functioning capitalism…Even if it’s difficult for some people to bear – there simply aren’t any simple solutions to which one can adhere.” Read interview with Heinrich here: <http://umsganze.org/historie/2007-g8/interview-with-michael-heinrich/>

And further, regarding these contradictions emanating from the basic structure of capitalism Heinrich writes in *An Introduction*…:

> “What Marx criticizes is not a specific distribution of goods or income, but the ‘miserable’ working and living conditions, in a comprehensive sense, which he characterizes with terms such as ‘endless drudgery and toil’ ‘ignorance’ and ‘brutalization’. Marx wants to make clear that the basic structure of such conditions are not just maladies characteristic of capitalism’s infancy, they remain throughout the development of capitalism – regardless of changes to their concrete appearance. Since the sole aim of the capitalist process is valorization and an increasingly improved valorization, and humans and nature are treated as mere instruments of valorization, this process possesses an *intrinsic destructiveness* \[my emphasis – CH\] toward humans and nature that constantly produces these miserable living conditions in newer forms, even in the case of an increased standard of living.”(Page 129)

Heinrich makes clear that Marx is not making a “moral critique” of capitalism but is “providing evidence of how capitalism actually functions.” And Marx’s “conclusion”? “\[I\]f one is actually interested in changing these miserable conditions, then one has no other option than the *abolition of capitalism*”. (Page 129)

In explaining value objectivity and the distinction between Marx’s view of value as a relation, and the view of traditional Marxism, Heinrich puts forth his analysis partly in the form of an analogy, on page 54:

> “Normally, objective properties of things are inherent, regardless of their relationship to other things. We do not regard properties of things that only exist in a specific connection to other things as objective, inherent properties of those things, but rather as relations. If soldier A is commanded by staff sergeant B, then A is a subordinate and B is a superior. The property of being a subordinate or a superior arises from the specific *relationship* between A and B within a military hierarchy, but are not inherent to them as people outside of this hierarchy.”

*but*

> “In the case of value, a property that only exists within a relationship *appears* to be an objective property that is also inherent outside of this relationship. If we attempt to locate this objectivity outside of the exchange relationship it eludes our grasp. The objectivity of value is quite literally a ‘spectral objectivity’.
> 
> Traditional Marxism was also taken in by the illusions that value was a property of an individual commodity. The substance of value was understood in a ‘substantialist way’, as a property of an *individual* commodity. The magnitude of value was also understood as a property of an individual commodity and it was believed to be determined, independent of the exchange process, by the quantity of socially necessary labor-time expended in the *production* of the commodity. Conceptions that emphasize the importance of exchange were accused of advancing a circulation theory of value, and thus of approaching value by placing emphasis on a supposedly negligible aspect.”

### The “either/or question”

For Heinrich, the “question as to whether value and the magnitude of value are determined in the sphere of production or in the sphere of circulation (the buying and selling) is the result of a fatal reduction. Value isn’t just ‘there’ after being ‘produced’ someplace….value isn’t a thing … but rather a social relationship that *appears as a tangible characteristic* of a thing. The social relationship that is expressed in value and the magnitude of value is constituted in production *and* circulation so that the “either/or” question is senseless.” (Page 54).

Heinrich offers this quote from Marx: “It is only by being exchanged that the products of labour acquire a socially uniform objectivity as values, \[Wertgegenstandlichkeit\] which is distinct from their sensuously varied objectivity as articles of utility” (*Capital*, 1:166). (Page 230, footnote 11)

The point that Marx is making in the above quote is critical to being able to understand the distinction between objectivity as it exists in an object of use, a product of labor, and, on the other hand, objectivity which exists *solely* in an historically specific social practice, in the form of abstract labor which is specific to commodity producing society.

### Impersonal, objective domination

Therefore, Heinrich writes on page 75: “The value of commodities is an expression of an overwhelming social interaction that cannot be controlled by individuals. In a commodity producing society, people (all of them!) are under the control of things and the decisive relations of domination are not personal but ‘objective’ (sachlich). This impersonal, objective domination, submission to ‘inherent necessities,’ does not exist because things themselves possess characteristics that generate such domination, or because social activity necessitates this mediation through things, but only because *people relate to things in a particular way – as commodities.”*

That only happens when exchange has historically developed to a certain point so that use-values are already generally produced for *exchange*, and their character as *values* must have become a fundamental element in the production process itself.

Clearly, value requires exchange, but that very exchange is already pre-supposed at the point of production itself; it’s why the product is being produced as Heinrich emphasizes by referring to the above quote by Marx. In my opinion there is no basis for the claim that Heinrich is a “circulationist.”

### The Money Form

In the “Public Discussion” lecture, there is a discussion of Heinrich’s monetary theory of value which he says was not an expression ever used by Marx but was an expression coined in the 1970’s by Hans-Georg Backhaaus (and that a monetary theory is implied in Marx’s critique of political economy). Heinrich emphasizes that a commodity producing society cannot exist without the money form. It is embodied within it. The connection between labor, value and money was not made by the classical bourgeois economists, nor is it apparent in traditional Marxism.

He uses this quote below from Marx:

> “Everyone knows, if nothing else, that commodities have a common value-form, which contrasts in the most striking manner with the motley natural forms of their use-values. I refer to the money form. Now, however, we have to perform a task never even attempted by bourgeois economics. That is, we have to show the origin \[*Genesis*\] of this money-form, we have to trace the development of the expression of value contained in the value-relation of commodities from its simplest, almost imperceptible outline to the dazzling money-form (*Capital*, 1:139) (*An Introduction…*, Page 55 and 56)

This statement by Marx has caused a lot of confusion and misunderstanding in its interpretation, according to Heinrich. Heinrich emphasizes that it was not the “*historical emergence of money*” that Marx was attempting to trace, but rather a “*conceptual relationship of development*”. That is, “a conceptual reconstruction of the connection between the “simple form of value” and the “money form”. The more general question, he writes, “is whether money in a commodity-producing society is merely a practical aid (which is otherwise basically dispensable) or whether money is in fact a *necessity*.” (Page 56)

In other words, the fact that money existed in Ancient Greece, or in any pre-capitalist society was not central to Marx’s task in analyzing “the dazzling money-form.” (Page 56)

On Page 78 Heinrich writes: “Whereas commodities are useful objects that *additionally* have the objective status of being values, money is *directly* a ‘value-thing’” (*Wertding*).

Therefore, the money form, as Heinrich makes clear in his book *An Introduction…* and his lecture “Public Discussion” corresponds to Marx’s value analysis and is an “inherent” and “necessary” *form* of commodity producing society.

> “For that reason, Marx can speak of money as the ‘necessary’ form of appearance of the immanent value measurement by labor time: value-constituting labor-time cannot be otherwise measured except through money.” (Footnote 16, page 231 “*In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy*, Marx describes money as the direct embodiment of abstract labour” (*MECW*, 29:297) (Page 65)

Heinrich quotes Marx to emphasize what happens in commodity exchange:

> “In their difficulties our commodity owners think like Faust: ‘In the beginning was the deed.’ (……) They have therefore already acted before thinking. The natural laws of the commodity have manifested themselves in the natural instinct of the owners of the commodities. They can only bring their commodities into relation as values, and therefore as commodities, by bringing them into an opposing relation with some one other commodity, which serves as the universal equivalent. We have already reached that result by our analysis of the commodity. \[The form analysis undertaken by Marx in the first chapter that we dealt with in the previous sections. – M.H.\] *But only the action of society can turn a particular commodity into the universal equivalent*. The social action of all other commodities, therefore, sets apart the particular commodity in which they all represent their values. The natural form of this commodity thereby becomes the socially recognized equivalent form. Through the agency of the social process it becomes the specific social function of the commodity which has been set apart to be the universal equivalent. It thus becomes – money. (*Capital*, 1:180-181; emphasis added (ibid, Page 62-63)

Why does Heinrich highlight in this particular statement in the above quote by Marx, that ‘*only the action of society can turn a particular commodity into the universal equivalent’*? He is highlighting that for Marx ‘individuals are embedded in social relations’. Heinrich states on Page 46 in *An Introduction…*, “These relations impose a certain form of rationality to which all individuals must adhere if they wish to maintain their existence within these conditions. If the actions correspond to this rationality, then the activity of individuals also reproduces the presupposed social relations…In a society based upon commodity exchange, everyone must follow the logic of exchange if he or she want to survive.”

And further, in that same section he writes: “With value theory, Marx seeks to uncover a specific social structure that individuals *must conform to, regardless of what they think*. The question posed by Marx is therefore completely different than that posed by classical or neoclassical economics; in principle, Adam Smith observes a single act of exchange and asks how the terms of exchange can be determined. Marx sees the individual exchange relation as part of a *particular social totality* – a totality in which the reproduction of society is mediated by exchange – and asks what this means for the labor expended by the *whole society*.” (Page 46-47)

Therefore, as Heinrich points out in his discussion of the money-form and the exchange process that occurs in a commodity producing society:

> “The analysis of the commodity revealed the necessity of the general equivalent *form.* In order to behave toward things as *commodities*, that is, to relate things to each other as *values*, the owners of commodities *must* relate their commodities to a general equivalent. Their ‘social act’ must make a commodity into a general equivalent and thus real ‘money’.” (Page 63)

Therefore, according to Heinrich, and rightly so I think, “Marx’s value theory is rather a *monetary theory of value*: without the value form, commodities cannot be related to one another as values, and only with the money form does an adequate form of value exist. ‘Substantialist’ conceptions of value, which attempt to establish the existence of value within individual objects, are *pre-monetary theories of value*. They attempt to develop a theory of value without reference to money. Both the labor theory of value of classical political economy and the theory of marginal utility of neoclassical economics are pre-monetary theories of value. The usual ‘Marxist’ value theory that alleges that value is already completely determined by ‘socially necessary labor-time’ is also a pre-monetary value theory.” (ibid, Page 63-64)

### In Conclusion:

Heinrich’s book provides an opportunity for discussion around an in-depth and broad examination of Marx’s theory of value (including the highly abstract and neglected categories of value and spectral objectivity). I repeat what I mentioned above. This is not an academic exercise, but rather an important and necessary political undertaking closely linked to the issue of a revolutionary subject and its consciousness.
